Basically, we controlled for the effects of non-numeric columns (gender and race/ethnicity) on the math
score. So firstly we load our dataset and look for the means of each factor and the significantly of each on for
influence on the score math, also of interaction between else.
Two-way ANOVA test hypotheses :
H0 : There is no difference in the means of gender between males and females.
H1 : There is no difference in means of race between group A, B, C, D and E.
Interaction : There is no interaction between gender and race. The alternative hypothesis for H0 and H1
is : the means are not equal. The alternative hypothesis for interaction is : there is an interaction between
genders and race.
